# Road-Traffic-Monitoring-System
This project utilizes OpenCV to automatically count and track vehicles in traffic surveillance videos(mp4). It employs background subtraction, morphology, and correlation tracking for high accuracy in both in-traffic and out-traffic scenarios. Contour analysis ensures robust vehicle identification by automating vehicle counting.
